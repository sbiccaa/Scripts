//Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.



// Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
function ourFunctionWitArgs(a, b) {
    console.log(a - b);
}
ourFunctionWitArgs(10,  5);

function FunctionWitArgs(a, b){
    console.log(a * b);
}
 FunctionWitArgs(11625000, 8);
